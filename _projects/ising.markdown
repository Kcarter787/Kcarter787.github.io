<b>What is Ising model?</b> <br>
Electrons spins are arranged in a graph, usually a lattice, allowing each spin to interact with its neighbors. The model allows the identification of phase transitions, as a simplified model of reality. The two-dimensional square-lattice Ising model is one of the simplest statistical models to show a phase transition.

The following videos are generated by a python simulation I wrote. They show
the interactions of electrons in a 50x50 lattice at low and high temperatures respectively.

Here's a small snippet of the python code:
{% highlight python %}
#   Calculate Energy of the system
def energy(system, N, M):
    return -1 * system[N, M] * (system[bc(N - 1), M] + system[bc(N + 1), M]
    + system[N, bc(M - 1)] + system[N, bc(M + 1)])

def internal_eng(system):
    e = 0
    E = 0
    E_2 = 0

    for i in range(SIZE):
        for j in range(SIZE):
            e = energy(system, i, j)
            E += e
            E_2 += e ** 2
    U = (1. / SIZE ** 2) * E
    U_2 = (1. / SIZE ** 2) * E_2
    return float(U), float(U_2)
{% endhighlight %}

Here's how it works in my own words:
